        ExerTracker is an application that keeps track of your exercises. It uses your phone\'s motion sensor to track your motion and count the exercises for you.
        \n\nHow to Use:
		\nTo start exercising, click the button corresponding to the exercise you would like to do. Then hit the Start button. As you exercise, ExerTracker will count for you. When you are done, click Done, and your exercise will be saved. You can do as many sets as you want of each exercise every day.
		\n\nTo view your progress over time, click the progress button at the bottom.
        \n\nTo see your personal records, click the records button at the bottom.

		For best results, your phone must be in an area that will move up and down during each exercise. If you have a case for mounting your phone to your upper arm, that will work for all of the default exercises. Otherwise, putting the phone in your pocket will work for all but sit-ups. For sit-ups, you can hold your phone in your hand so it moves with you.
